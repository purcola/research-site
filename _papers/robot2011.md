In this paper we propose a flexible navigation system for teams of coordinated robots.
Thanks to cooperative perception, they are able to analyze the situation and decide the best strategy to apply at each moment, resulting in a very adaptable technique.
This system is extended to be applied in a group guiding mission.
Robots are able to perceive and track people cooperatively so that they can identify some kind of behavior in guiding tasks such as people entering or leaving the guided group, adapting the robot team actions to each behavior.
Several simulations and experiments in different scenarios are presented and discussed.
