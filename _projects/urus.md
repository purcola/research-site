European cities are becoming difficult places to live due to noise, pollution and security. 
Moreover, the average age of people living European cities is growing and in a short period of time there will be an important community of elderly people. 

City Halls are becoming conscious of this problem and are studying solutions, for example by reducing the free car circulation areas. 
Free car areas imply a revolution in the planning of urban settings, for example, by imposing new means for transportation of goods, security issues, etc. 

In this project we want to analyse and test the idea of incorporating a network of robots (robots, intelligent sensors, devices and communications) in order to improve life quality in such urban areas.
