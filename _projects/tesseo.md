The project proposes to investigate techniques for a multi-robot team to act in coordination in realistic scenarios. 
For the deployment, it is necessary to deal with algorithms and methods related to task planning and allocation, coordinated navigation planning, environment perception from multiple views provided by every member of the team, while the communication connectivity among all the elements of the system is maintained – robots, infrastructure, supervisor team, etc. 

Although some of the techniques involved are usually proposed in the literature and in many projects somehow independently, the research in this project will also be oriented to develop techniques integrating the different subjects involved. 
Only in this way it will be possible to develop realistic applications using systems with autonomous and supervised behaviours.
