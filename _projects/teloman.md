The research project involves deployment and actuation techniques of a multi-robot team. 
It is necessary to address problems of task planning and allocation, coordinated execution of the navigation, perception of the environment from multiple views from each of the team members, maintaining communication between all system components – robots, infrastructure, bridges, monitoring equipment, etc. 

This project will address new goals and challenges for research and their application in real, large and complex scenarios.
