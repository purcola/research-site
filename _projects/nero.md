The complex nature of mobile robot tasks leads to the necessity of systems with several coordinated robots (agents) working in cooperation. 
Some international directives refer to robotic elements connected to the communication nets or wireless nets including the robots themselves and the sensors distributed in the working place (static agents) exchanging and sharing information. 
This concept is extended to robot interactions between humans, the sensors and the environment. 

We propose this project which is very related with previous MEC projects obtained by this research team, to continue working on subjects related to multi-robot cooperation techniques, computer vision, robot vision for motion and communications.
